# LaGuessy
## CSS 432 Rendition of GoFish
### Overview
LaGuessy is a rendition of the classic Go Fish game. It is a guessing game, where 2 players take turns guessing a card from each other’s hand to create matching pairs within their own hands. The winner is decided when a player reaches 5 points (a point per pair), leading by 2 points. When a player’s hand or the pool is empty, the game ends, and the player with more points wins. Ties are allowed.
